# XL2Images

A simple Python script that reads image URLs from an Excel file and downloads them to a local folder. Ideal for bulk downloading product images, datasets, or reference assets.

---

## Features

- Reads `.xlsx` files using `openpyxl`
- Downloads images via `requests`
- Supports custom columns and row ranges
- Skips invalid or missing URLs
- Automatically names files from URL or assigns a fallback name

---

## How It Works

1. Place your Excel file (e.g. `images.xlsx`) in the project directory.
2. The script reads URLs from a specified column (default: `A`).
3. It downloads and saves each image to the `downloaded_images` folder.

---

## Example Excel Layout

| A (Image URL)                     |
|----------------------------------|
| https://example.com/image1.jpg   |
| https://example.com/image2.jpg   |

> You can change the column or row starting point in the script.

---

## Configuration

Open the script and edit the following lines as needed:

```python
EXCEL_FILE = "products_list.xlsx"
COLUMN_WITH_URLS = 'A'
START_ROW = 2
DOWNLOAD_DIR = "downloaded_images"
````
